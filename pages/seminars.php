										<strong>18 July 2018: Hydrologic Prediction through Changes in Soil Moisture and Snowpack:  Estimating Natural and Anthropogenic Fluxes</strong></a>
									</p>
									<p>Speaker(s): Ben Livneh</p>
									<p><b>Abstract:</b>
									Water stored at the Earth surface—in the soil and snow—represents a window into the future and past, controlling the rate of water transfer to the atmosphere and rivers, and providing a basis for forecasting. The first part of this presentation will focus on two applications using remotely sensed soil moisture to estimate evaporation and irrigation. Evaporation is an integral component of the water balance, yet it’s estimation over large areas is limited by observational scarcity and is hence typically estimated using models. An approach for producing spatial estimates of evaporation using changes in soil moisture from NASA’s SMAP satellite will be presented and evaluated at a set of monitoring sites across the U.S.

Next, variations in remotely sensed soil moisture are evaluated as a means to estimate irrigation. Water withdrawals for agriculture represent the single largest consumptive use for many parts of the U.S., bearing a large anthropogenic footprint on the water and energy cycles. However, practical challenges exist in estimating irrigation magnitude and resulting impacts on water supply modeling. A synthetic data assimilation experiment is presented to estimate irrigation, with potential errors sources evaluated using land surface outputs in the place of remote sensing.

The last part of the presentation will focus on how the predictive value of snowpack-based drought indicators—identified as the most useful and reliable drought indicator by western U.S. water stakeholders—are expected change in a warmer world; where projections show more rain versus snow. Across the western U.S., snow-water equivalent (SWE) at key dates during the year (e.g., April 1) is routinely used in water resource planning as it embodies stored water to be released, through melt, during critical periods later in the summer. The robustness of these snowpack-based drought indicators will be assessed under historical and future climate.

										<strong>29 May 2018: The emerging role of the land surface in weather and climate prediction</strong></a>
									</p>
									<p>Speaker(s): Paul Dirmeyer</p>
									<p><b>Abstract:</b>
									Like the ocean, the land surface is a slowly varying manifold relative to the atmosphere that provides predictability and prediction skill across a range of time scales. Although the peak influence of land surface states is in the “subseasonal” time range between 1-3 weeks, significant impact of land, or errors in its representation, begins in forecasts the first morning of simulation. The process chains that link soil moisture, vegetation, snow, and other land states through the energy and water cycles manifest though their effects on the growing daytime boundary layer, cloud formation and convection. Thus, the diurnal cycle is key to assessing and improving model performance related to land-atmosphere interactions. Daily, monthly and seasonal mean skill arising from coupled land-atmosphere feedbacks can only improve by improving the diurnal cycle.

										<strong>Exploring Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for NWP and Situational Awareness Applications</strong></a>
									</p>
									<p>Speaker(s): Sid Boukabara</p>
									<p><b>Abstract:</b>
									The volume and diversity of environmental data obtained from a variety of Earth-observing systems, has experienced a significant increase in the last couple years with the advent of high spectral, high- spatial and temporal resolutions sensors. At the same time, users-driven requirements, especially for nowcasting and short-term forecasting applications but also for medium-range weather forecasting, strongly point to the need for providing this data in a consistent, comprehensive and consolidated fashion, combining space-based, air-based and surface-based sources, but at higher spatial and temporal resolutions and with low latency. This trend is expected to continue further with the emergence of commercial space-based data from multiple industry players and the advent of flotillas of small satellites (Cubesats) as well as new sources of data (such as Internet of Things IoT) to complement traditional environmental data. Yet, the data volume presents already a significant challenge. Satellite measurements input to data assimilation algorithms for instance, need to be aggressively thinned spatially, spectrally and temporally in order to allow the products generation, calibration, assimilation and forecast system to be executed. Only a fraction of satellite data gets actually assimilated. Taking full advantage of all the observations, allowing more sources of observations to be used for initial conditions setting, and to do it within an ever shrinking window of assimilation/dissemination, requires exploring new approaches for processing the data, from ingest to dissemination. We present in this study the results of a pilot project’s effort to use cognitive learning approaches for numerical weather prediction (NWP) applications. The Google’s machine learning open-source tool TensorFlow, used for many Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, was used to reproduce the performances of remote sensing and some data assimilation tools (radiative transfer), with flexibility to extend to other sources such as IoT. The approach relies on training a deep-layer neural network on a set of inputs from NASA’s GEOS-5 Nature Run (NR) as well as ECMWF analyses, along with corresponding observations simulated  using the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) and other forward operators. The present study demonstrates the proof of concept and shows that using AI holds significant promise in potentially addressing the vexing issue of computational power and time requirements needed to handle the extraordinarily highvolume of environmental data, current and expected. It is found that AI-based algorithms have dramatically lower execution times, and provide very favorable performances when compared to traditional approaches.
